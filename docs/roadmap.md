## Access control: accounts, roles, and a permissions surface (to revisit — 2026-06-25)

**Context:** Surfaced while building basic forms — the inbox let anyone delete submissions, the forms API (and the git API) are unauthenticated, and there's no place for an admin to set who-can-do-what. Setu currently assumes a **single trusted owner** (self-hosted).

**What already exists (the good core):** `packages/core/src/authz/` has a real model — a role→capability matrix (`default-roles.ts`: Owner/Admin = all; Editor = `content.create/edit/delete/publish/unpublish`; Author = `create/edit`) and `authz.can(actor, action)` over actions `content.create|edit|delete|publish|unpublish`. An `Actor` + `authMiddleware` + `resolveLocalOwner` exist on `apps/api`.

**What's missing (the unbuilt subsystem):**
1. **Accounts + sessions + an auth provider** — there are no users; the admin runs as one hard-coded local Owner.
2. **Enforcement across write routes** — only `/media` calls `authz.can(...)`; the **git API and forms API are unauthenticated**, and `content.delete` is a defined action that nothing enforces.
3. **A permissions/roles management UI** — the role matrix is a constant in `default-roles.ts`; no screen to invite users, assign roles, or edit capabilities.
4. **Admin-UI gating** — affordances (delete, publish, settings) should hide/disable per the actor's capabilities, not just the API.

**Why deferred:** v1 targets single-owner dev/self-hosted; multi-user auth is a large feature (accounts → sessions → role assignment UI → enforce `can()` everywhere → gate UI). The basic-forms final review explicitly flagged "gate the admin CRUD when auth lands."

**Process note (from the same conversation):** when building any *write* surface, actively surface the auth dimension ("is this endpoint/affordance meant to be permission-gated?") rather than silently inheriting the unauthenticated-local convention. The capability primitives already exist; new features should wire `authz.can()` even while single-owner, so enforcement is in place when accounts arrive.

**Touches:** a new auth/accounts package + provider; session middleware on `apps/api`; `authz.can()` calls on every mutating route (git commit/commitFiles, publish, forms CRUD, taxonomy, media — already done); an admin "Users & roles" screen; actor-aware gating in admin components. Its own brainstorm → spec → plan.

## Git-backed comments (DB buffer → sync to Git) (to revisit — 2026-06-21)

**Idea:** comments as owned, versioned content — `comment → approve → commit`, the exact generalization of the existing `draft → publish → commit`. Validates the Git/DB split rather than straining it: the DB does the runtime work it's good at; Git holds the durable owned record.

**Design (the right model — "DB as buffer, sync to Git"):**
1. Visitor submits → written to the **DB** immediately (instant display, absorbs volume, moderation queue lives here).
2. Moderate (approve / spam / delete) entirely in the DB — fast; **spam never touches Git**.
3. On approve (or batched on a schedule) → `commitFiles()` the approved comments into Git as data files (e.g. `content/<collection>/<locale>/<slug>/comments/<id>.yaml`), **batched** (1 commit/post/day, not 1/comment → no repo bloat / write storm). Moderation-delete → a `commitFiles` delete.

**Why it fits cleanly:** rides rails already built — `DataPort` is the buffer, `GitPort.commitFiles` (atomic multi-file commit **with deletes**) is the sync, `git-http`/`apps/api` is the write path (a static site can't self-write — comment submit needs a serverless write endpoint, NOT a database-as-truth).

**Source-of-truth precision:** Git is canonical for *settled/approved* comments; the DB is truth for *in-flight/pending* (same as draft vs published). Serve reads from the DB (fresh); if the DB is lost, rebuild it from Git — same rule as the content index.

**When NOT to:** real-time/social-scale/heavy-personalization comment volumes → just use a DB or a comments service; the Git-sync only earns its keep when you actually want comments owned + portable + versioned alongside the content (blog/docs/brand sites). Precedent: Staticman (files-in-repo), Giscus/Utterances (GitHub Discussions/Issues store).

**Touches:** a comments `DataPort`-style buffer + moderation; a sync/reconciler using `GitPort.commitFiles`; a write endpoint on `apps/api`; site-side render (baked at build and/or client-fetch JS island); depends on the [[server topology]] write path (see entry below). Same shape as the existing publish flow.

---

## Single-source content topology + repo/deploy model (to revisit — 2026-06-20)

**Context:** The admin's default browser/IndexedDB mode stores content per-origin, so it appears to "disappear" across ports/worktrees and is disconnected from the real `content/` files. The proper dev stack (`pnpm dev`) already manages a real on-disk content repo via the API (git-local) — so *published* content is single-source on disk. Three deliberate follow-ups surfaced while fixing dev-content confusion:

1. **Cut B — server-side drafts.** Today drafts still live in the browser (per-origin); only *published* content is on the server. Make drafts single-source too: a new `packages/db-http` adapter + data/lock routes on `apps/api` (`createDataApi`) backed by `db-sqlite`, and `Bootstrap` using the http DataPort in API mode. (`db-sqlite` + `runDataPortContract` already exist; `db-http` + the routes do not. The index can stay a derived per-browser idb cache.) This is a real product feature — how the server topology should work for any Setu user — not a dev hack.

2. **Fixed / worktree-independent content location.** Point the dev stack at one stable content repo path (env-overridable, resolved from the *main* checkout, not `$PWD`) so every worktree's admin manages the same content. Small (dev-script change).

3. **Repo topology + deploy pipeline.** Decide **one repo** (content as a subfolder of the site repo — simplest, solo) vs **two repos** (`setu/` app + `content/` data — clean separation, multi-editor / one-engine-many-sites; the product vision). Then the build/deploy: `astro build` combining app + content, media **pre-generated at upload** and copied into the static output at `/media/...` (no build/request-time image work → Cloudflare-Pages-safe), shipped to Cloudflare Pages. Media in the content repo locally; swappable to R2/S3 via `StoragePort` later. Owner currently undecided on one-vs-two repos.

**Why noted:** the immediate dev pain is solved by running `pnpm dev` against the on-disk content repo; these are the deliberate next steps toward the real content/build/deploy model.

**Touches:** new `packages/db-http`; `apps/api` data routes + `server.ts` sqlite wiring; `apps/admin` `Bootstrap`; root `pnpm dev` / content-sandbox script; (later) CI/deploy + an Astro media-copy step.

## Media / Images (active next — 2026-06-19)

PRD §11 + §17 specify this; the decomposition + the optimization decisions below were refined with
the owner (2026-06-19). Built hexagonally (Port + contract suite + adapters), same shape as `DataPort`.

**Sub-projects (build order):**

| # | Sub-project | Delivers |
|---|---|---|
| ~~**1**~~ ✅ | ~~**`StoragePort` + contract suite + `storage-local`**~~ SHIPPED (`e1aeac7`) | the storage *foundation* — a **dumb keyed-blob store** (put/get/delete/url), an in-memory reference + a local-disk adapter, one contract battery every adapter runs |
| ~~2~~ ✅ | ~~**Upload service + API**~~ SHIPPED 2026-06-19 | auth-gated upload flow (admin → Hono api → StoragePort → URL); the visible "drop a file, get a link" win — see notes below |
| ~~3~~ ✅ | ~~**Editor image block + round-trip**~~ SHIPPED 2026-06-19 (`8e3d1ef`) | inline Tiptap image node, alt-text, `![alt](src)` Markdoc round-trip, site render — content stores host-free `/uploads/media/<id>/original.<ext>` (id-in-path, env-mapped prefix); inline node (Markdoc-faithful, content-safe). Editor resolves display src via `VITE_SETU_API`, site via `PUBLIC_SETU_MEDIA`. Plain `<img>` (optimization = #4) |
| 4 | **`ImagePort` + optimization** | variants/srcset/focal/quality — upgrades the shipped `Image.astro` in place; see the decisions below. **#4a foundation ✅ + #4b ingest ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-19 (`96b9aea`, `81dc857`)**: edge-safe `ImagePort` (metadata + generate, never-upscale, aspect-preserving) in `@setu/core` + `@setu/image-testing` contract battery + `@setu/image-sharp` adapter (sharp 0.35, AVIF/WebP/JPEG/PNG). **#4c srcset render ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-20 (`d1bbee0`)**: Image.astro reads the manifest at build → responsive `<img srcset sizes width height>`, plain-img fallback. Remaining: **#4d** focal, **#4e** per-image quality, **#4f** queued (+ AVIF). **#4b note (from #4a review):** centralize `format→ext` (`jpeg`→`jpg`!) + `format→contentType` in `@setu/core` (the `CONTENT_TYPE` map is duplicated in image-testing + image-sharp; #4b builds keys `media/<id>/<name>.<ext>`) |
| 5 | **`{% image %}` rich block** | the first **per-type rich tag** — caption, alignment, link-on-click, lightbox; renders semantic `<figure>`/`<figcaption>`; coexists with inline `![alt](src)` (#3). **#5a render ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-20**: `{% image %}` render tag → responsive `<figure><img srcset sizes width height><figcaption>` reusing #4c `Image.astro`, alignment `none\|left\|right\|wide\|full` (Gutenberg 1:1) with per-alignment `sizes` (`sizesForAlign`) + theme break-out CSS; render-only — editor passthrough-safe (core guard test). **Remaining: #5b** dedicated bodyless `imageBlock` editor node (preview/alt/inline-caption/alignment toolbar) + add `image` to `knownBlockTags` + switch upload/insert to create the block by default (⚠️ when it lands, the `image-block-roundtrip` passthrough guard must be deliberately updated to the new node shape, NOT auto-fixed). **Later:** rich inline captions, display-width/drag-resize, link-on-click + lightbox, focal (#4d) |
| 5½ | **Human-readable media keys** (owner-decided 2026-06-20) | **SUPERSEDES the opaque `media/<uuid>/…` key scheme.** Store at WordPress-style **`<year>/<month>/<original-filename>-<size>.<format>`** (e.g. `/uploads/2026/06/my-cat-photo-800w.webp`); original = `…/my-cat-photo.jpg`. Owner rejected both the current UUID-in-path AND a bare slug — wants date + filename for **SEO + the "for non-coders" feel**. Cross-cutting: changes the upload key (#2), ingest/manifest keys (#4b), the render manifest lookup (`manifestIdFromSrc`/#4c), and the content src (`![](/uploads/2026/06/…)`). **Needs a short brainstorm** — open Qs: filename collision dedup (`-1`, sanitize), where the manifest + a stable internal id live (registry holds id ↔ human path so URLs stay human while ids stay stable), variant naming (`-800w` vs `-800x600`), migration of existing UUID-keyed content. Lands **before #6** (the registry builds on this key scheme). |
| 6 | **Media library UI + registry** | browse / reuse / search / alt-text in the admin; the **media registry** (id → metadata / variants / locations); pairs with #5½ (registry maps a stable internal id ↔ the human `YYYY/MM/filename` path) |
| 7 | **`@setu/storage-s3`** | the S3-compatible adapter (R2/B2/AWS/MinIO) — drops in against the *same* contract; independent plumbing, can land anytime |
| 8 | **`{% video %}` + `{% audio %}` blocks** | per-type rich tags for A/V — the upload service already accepts these; editor blocks + `<figure>` render + round-trip. **Independent of #4** (no image optimization). Build when needed (blog-first may defer) |
| 9 | **`{% embed %}` block** | oEmbed / provider URLs (YouTube, etc.) — no upload; arguably its **own sub-project**, not media-storage |
| — | **`{% gallery %}` (deferred)** | multi-image block; depends on `{% image %}` (#5) |
| — | **Private/access-controlled media (deferred)** | the `signUrl()` + auth-gated-serving story (signed URLs for private assets) |

**Build-order note (owner, 2026-06-19):** the **plumbing track** (#4 ImagePort → #6 library → #7 S3) and the
**rich-blocks track** (#5 `{% image %}` → #8 A/V → #9 embed) run mostly in parallel; the only hard
dependency is `{% image %}`'s focal-point/responsive bits riding on #4. Priority chosen: **#4 → #5
(rich image) → #6 library → #7 S3**, because captioned/aligned images are the most-felt gap and the
library is more valuable once richer media exists. `{% video %}`/`{% audio %}`/`{% embed %}` are
scheduled but **build-when-needed** (a blog-first CMS may defer them). "media" stays the **subsystem**
name throughout — never a content tag (see the rich-media taxonomy note below).

**`StoragePort` = dumb bytes (decided):** the port stores/serves keyed blobs only; **variants are just
more keys the `ImagePort` manages**. Keeps the port + local/S3 adapters trivial; all size/variant/
focal/quality logic lives in the ImagePort.

**NORTH STAR — Gutenberg / Tiptap-Pro-grade rich media (owner ambition, 2026-06-19; taxonomy locked
2026-06-19):** the eventual experience should match WordPress Gutenberg / Tiptap's paid nodes —
**caption, alignment (left/center/wide/full), resize/width, link-on-click, focal point, lightbox**.
Plain `![alt](src)` **cannot** carry any of that, so the rich tier is **Setu tags** (human-readable +
lossless through `@setu/core`, but not vanilla Markdown for those — same portability tradeoff as
attributed links). **TAXONOMY (owner, locked):** **"media" is the SUBSYSTEM name** (StoragePort,
upload service, `ImagePort`, media-library UI) — it is **NEVER a content tag**. Content uses
**per-type rich tags** (Gutenberg's model — controls differ per type, so distinct blocks, not one
umbrella): **`{% image %}`** (rich image: caption/alignment/focal/lightbox), **`{% video %}`**,
**`{% audio %}`**, **`{% embed %}`** — each rendering semantic `<figure>`/`<figcaption>`. (Rejected:
a single `{% media %}` umbrella block — muddy conditional UI; and `{% figure %}` — that names the HTML
wrapper element, not the block.) **Image-model layering:** inline `![alt](src)` (simple, pure Markdown,
SHIPPED #3) → **`{% image %}`** tag (rich, Setu tag) → `ImagePort` variants/srcset underneath both.
Slice #3's inline node is the lightweight tier + the foundation, NOT a dead end; #4+ build toward this.

**Upload service (#2) — SHIPPED notes (2026-06-19):** `POST /media` on `@setu/api` — a pluggable
**auth seam** (`ResolveActor`, dev-stubbed to the local owner; real JWT/session slots in later with
zero route changes) gating an upload that stores at `media/<uuid>/original.<ext>` via `StoragePort`
and returns a loadable URL; `GET /uploads/*` is the **Node/dev serving path** (image inline / else
`Content-Disposition: attachment`; key guarded to the `media/` keyspace). Validation: 25 MB cap +
17-type allowlist (SVG/HTML/JS blocked). Admin `/media` page = the visible "drop a file → link +
preview" win. **Deferred follow-ups (recorded):** (a) `c.req.formData()` buffers the whole body
before the `file.size` 413 check — cap protects **disk, not memory**; add a streaming/`bodyLimit`
guard (or rely on the edge request-size limit) **when real auth lands and the endpoint faces
untrusted clients**. (b) `cors()` uses the default `*` origin (matches the existing git api) —
restrict to the admin origin when real auth lands. (c) a dedicated `media.upload` authz action (the
slice reuses `content.create`).

**VERIFIED CONSTRAINT (web-checked 2026-06-19) — sharp does NOT run on Cloudflare Workers/Pages
Functions.** sharp is a native libvips binary; the Workers runtime can't load native modules — a
hard capability wall, NOT a limits/free-tier issue ([cloudflare/workers-sdk#12338], [sharp#3860]).
BUT *build-time* sharp works on ALL topologies (the BUILD runs on a Node/Linux machine, even for CF
Pages — only the runtime Worker is sharp-less).

**`ImagePort` / optimization decisions (#4 — owner, 2026-06-19; reframes the PRD's "build-time sharp
default"):**
- **STORE-ONCE model (unifying, verified 2026-06-19):** the ImagePort's job is **generate variants
  ONCE → persist them to the StoragePort → serve the static files**. The transform engine is the only
  topology difference; the downstream (stored variant objects + srcset + static CDN serving, **zero
  per-render transform cost**) is identical everywhere.
- **Three transform engines behind one interface, by topology:** **at-upload sharp on Node** (local +
  self-hosted — the preferred default) | **Cloudflare Images Workers binding on edge** (Workers can't
  run sharp; the binding transforms in the Worker and **writes the output straight to R2** — Cloudflare
  explicitly supports "transform → upload to R2 without serving") | **at-build sharp** as a fallback.
  **CF Images is a GENERATION-TIME engine, NOT a per-render service.** Billing (verified): **per
  transformation *call*** — one per variant generated, store-or-serve irrespective; free plan 5,000
  transforms/month → a *one-time* generation cost per image, then free static serving. (Prefer
  store-once over Cloudflare's on-the-fly `/cdn-cgi/image/` URL transforms: those are CDN-cached but
  re-bill on cache miss and you don't own the files.) The shipped `StoragePort` is exactly where every
  variant lands.
- **Generation-timing knob:** when variants are generated is a policy — on-upload (sync) /
  background-queued / batch / defer-to-build. A bulk import (e.g. 200 images) would queue/background.
- **Theme-author-declared sizes** (WordPress `add_image_size`-style): theme + site config declare
  named sizes / breakpoint widths; the admin can add custom thumbnails; the ImagePort generates
  exactly those variants.
- **Responsive `srcset`:** Astro `<Image>` emits `srcset`+`sizes` (verified — pass `widths`, or
  `layout="constrained"` auto-picks device widths), but it resizes at BUILD. With at-upload variants
  we reference our own pre-generated files and emit the srcset ourselves (we know them). The ImagePort
  picks which path.
- **Focal point:** default = sharp smart-crop (`position:'entropy'`/`'attention'` — automatic focal
  point); **optional** manual focal point stored per image, optionally per-device (art direction via
  `<Picture>`). Astro has no native focal-point crop → ImagePort logic.
- **Compression/format/quality:** sharp does per-format quality/effort/lossless (AVIF/WebP/JPEG/PNG).
  Expose sparingly: global defaults (AVIF+WebP ~q70–80) + optional per-image override (format +
  quality). Don't surface every knob.
- **Security (PRD §17):** auth-gated upload sign (`POST /api/upload/sign` → 401 without session);
  size caps (presigned `content-length-range`, ~5 MB).

## Render / Theme layer

Vision + decomposition: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-setu-render-theme-vision.md`
(5 sub-projects; lean frame — default theme + tokens, AI/MCP an accelerant not the identity;
"write once" React core + generated editor/site shells; theme = HTML/CSS/tokens, React sealed).

### ~~Render pipeline #1 — content → static HTML~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 (`7ec53f1`)

`apps/site` (Astro 6 + `@astrojs/markdoc` + `@astrojs/react`) renders committed `.mdoc`
to static HTML (zero JS): standard nodes + callout (one React core + wrapper) + text-align +
sub/sup + checklist + table-column align. **Resolves the deferred render-time mappings**
(text-align + table-column alignment now actually render on the page). Default locale unprefixed
in URLs. Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-17-setu-render-pipeline*`.

### ~~Block component package #2 — one shared callout core~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 (`08f1afd`)

New `@setu/blocks` package holds the callout's **single React visual core** (+ block icons +
variant mapping + token-fallback `callout.css`). The editor node view AND the site wrapper now
render it — the duplicate is gone (deleted `apps/admin/.../callout-variants.ts` +
`apps/site/.../Callout.tsx` + the hardcoded 💡). "Write once" closed. Editor node
definition + round-trip byte-identical (guard green); `react` is a peerDependency; CSS uses
`var(--token, fallback)` (admin themed, site fallbacks — pixel parity follows in #3). Spec/plan:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-18-setu-block-component-package*`.

### ~~Default theme #3a — designed look, token-driven~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 (`bd15af4`)

The Setu site now looks designed: one typographic identity (bold-sans/indigo), a header/footer
shell, **Post (narrow) + Page (wider contained) templates by collection** + a home route — built
entirely from **tokens-with-defaults on `:root`** so it's customization-ready (change a token →
the site restyles). Blocks render themed via those tokens (callout matches the editor). `<html
lang>` carries the entry locale; light-only, zero-JS. Look designed with the owner via the visual
companion. Theme lives in `apps/site` for now. Spec/plan:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-18-setu-default-theme*`.

### ~~Theme system #3b — themes as config-activated packages~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 (`246da2a`)

The default theme is now an installable, **config-activated package** (`@setu/theme-default` —
layouts + tokens + styles, extracted from the site). `@setu/core` config gained an optional
`theme` field (additive; round-trip untouched); `apps/site/setu.config.ts` names the active
theme, and the build reads it (`loadConfig`) + aliases `@theme` → the package, so pages render
through whichever theme is configured. **Switch the value + install another theme + rebuild →
different theme.** No visible change (the success criterion — 27 site tests green unchanged); the
render engine (routing/markdoc/block components) stays in the app. Spec/plan:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-18-setu-theme-system*`.

### ~~Theme options #3c — declarative options engine + self-hosted fonts~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 (`36aee29`)

The Customizer **engine** (the visual admin panel deferred to the editor→disk bridge). A theme now
**declares its tunable knobs** in `options.ts` (`themeOptions: ThemeOption[]` — accent/font/width/
textSize/corners; the "options API" the owner asked for) + a **pure `optionsToCss(values)`** that
maps chosen values → a `:root:root { … }` override string (fallback-to-default; never emits garbage).
`@setu/core` config gained an additive optional `themeOptions` map (mirrors the 3b `theme` field;
round-trip untouched). The site build threads `setu.config`'s `themeOptions` → pages → templates →
`Layout`, which injects the override as the last `<head>` style — `:root:root` specificity (Astro
puts the bundled theme `<link>` *after* an inline style, so source-order loses). `--accent-strong`
now derives from `--accent` via `color-mix`. **Defaults kept → site looks identical** (engine proven
by tests). **Fonts self-hosted via `@fontsource` on BOTH the site theme and the admin chrome →
runtime Google-Fonts dependency removed repo-wide** (curated 6-font shortlist + JetBrains Mono; each
variable pkg registers `'<Name> Variable'`; only the selected font downloads). Whole repo green
(core 180, blocks 8, theme-default 10 [new], site 30, admin 178), both apps build, zero-JS. Spec/plan:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-18-setu-theme-options*`.

**Next render-layer sub-projects (deferred, sequenced):**
- **The visual Customizer panel** (the admin UI for #3c's engine): renders generically from any
  theme's `options.ts` manifest (color picker / font dropdown / width+size+corner selects) with live
  preview, then **Save**. The full WordPress loop (Save → live site changes) needs the **editor→disk
  bridge** to persist the chosen `themeOptions` where the published site reads them — so this lands
  after (or with) that bridge. The engine + manifest are done; this is "render the form + persist."
- **child-theme override** (deferred from 3b, PRD §8): config-based per-component/token override
  (map `Callout → MyCallout.astro`) — the advanced "child theme without forking"; harder dynamic
  per-block resolution; lower priority than 3c.
- **#4 custom-component pipeline + codegen** — a block is a self-contained folder fanning out to
  all 3 planes.
  - **Slice A ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-19 (`ba286d4`):** auto-discovery + registration codegen. `blocks/<tag>/`
    (`block.ts` zod contract + `<tag>.astro`); one registry feeds editor slash + round-trip
    `knownBlockTags` + a build-time `scripts/gen-blocks.mjs` codegen of the site's `markdoc.config`
    tags (resolves the #1 "can't import core TS" wall). Central `setu.config.blocks` retired; callout
    migrated zero-change. Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-19-*block-autodiscovery-codegen*`.
  - **Slice B (in progress 2026-06-19):** the generic `setuBlock` round-trip node + a generic editor
    node (chrome + auto-form from `markdocAttributesFor(props)`) so a *new* (non-callout) folder block
    works end-to-end. Proven with a **dependency-free** `notice` block (deliberately, see below).
  - **DEFERRED — block packaging / `blocks/` location refactor** (trigger: the first block that needs
    npm deps). `blocks/` lives at the repo root, outside any package's dependency tree, so a block's
    bare imports (`@setu/blocks`, etc.) don't resolve by the normal node walk-up — patched today with
    explicit resolver entries in 3 tools (admin Vite / gen-blocks jiti / site Rollup), one per dep.
    Permanent fix = give blocks a real home (workspace package, or generated per-block `package.json`),
    entangled with the end-user packaging story (`create-setu`). Dep-free blocks have ZERO friction, so
    deferring costs nothing until forced; the move itself is cheap + test-covered.
  - **DEFERRED — interactive / dependency blocks (Rung 3) + their edge endpoints** (the "dreamers"
    pillar). A real interactive block (e.g. a Stripe **buy** block, a Three.js scene, a live search) is
    THREE layers: (1) a portable content tag (`{% buy product=… %}`, zero deps, round-trips); (2) a
    **client island** importing an npm pkg (`@stripe/stripe-js`) shipped via `client:*` — the real
    "block needs a dependency" case; (3) a **server endpoint** for secret-key work (`stripe` server SDK,
    Checkout Sessions, webhooks) that MUST live at the **edge (Pages Function/Worker), never in the
    static bundle** — i.e. the SSR/edge topology (Pro). This is its own sub-project (islands + edge
    endpoints + secret handling + customer packaging), pairs with the edge topology + `create-setu`.
- **#5 in-editor preview** — draft preview through the same theme + components, iframed.
- **permalink + i18n URL scheme** — the full locale-prefixing policy (#1 only strips the
  default `en`; config-driven default + non-default front-prefixing is its own slice).
- **dynamic Markdoc** (`{% if %}`/`{% for %}`/`$vars`) in passthrough — Pro/SSR, long-deferred.

### "View Site" / "View Page" links in the admin — preview vs live aware (added 2026-06-18)

**What (owner ask):** from the admin, give the writer **"View Site"** (site root) and **"View
Page"** (this entry's rendered URL) links. The system should **detect the entry's state and
label/target accordingly** — e.g. a not-yet-deployed entry → a **Preview** link (draft preview),
a deployed entry → **"View Live"** to the published URL.

**Why it's its own item (not trivial):** (a) it needs a **shared permalink util** — the admin
must derive the same URL the site renders (`apps/site/src/lib/url.ts` logic: collection/
locale/slug → URL, default locale unprefixed), so this couples to the deferred **permalink/i18n
scheme**. (b) "preview vs live" keys off the **derived lifecycle** (`deriveLifecycle` →
draft/staged/live) already in the admin — Live → real published URL; Draft/Staged → the **#5
in-editor/SSR preview** route (which doesn't exist yet). So this lands cleanly *after* #3 (a real
site/theme to view) and ideally alongside **#5 preview**. Small UI, but it's the seam that ties
the admin's lifecycle pill to actual rendered URLs.

## Tooling / DX

### ~~Single command to launch all dev servers locally~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 (`371ac42`, with the Local Bridge)

Root `pnpm dev` boots **api + admin + site** together via `concurrently` (labeled api/admin/site,
distinct colors, one-Ctrl-C shutdown, fixed ports api 4444 / admin 5173 / site 4321), wiring
`VITE_SETU_API` into the admin and `SETU_REPO_DIR`/`SETU_API_PORT` into the api. Shipped as part
of the Local Bridge increment (the bridge needs all three running to be usable). See below.

## Backend / Platform

### Editor→disk bridge / multi-topology — make admin + site share one store (added 2026-06-18; topology model refined 2026-06-18)

**The gap (owner noticed during UAT):** the admin and the front-end site are **two separate
content worlds today**. The admin runs entirely **in the browser** — drafts/posts live in
**IndexedDB**, its "git" is in-browser (`db-idb`/`git-idb`, wired in `apps/admin/src/data/Bootstrap.tsx`).
The site (`apps/site`) renders only the **on-disk `.mdoc` fixtures** (Astro globs
`base: './content'` in `src/content.config.ts`). So **publishing in the admin does not appear on
the site**, and vice-versa.

**Verified current state (read the code 2026-06-18 — roadmap's old "already built" list is ACCURATE):**
the **ports + services are real and adapter-agnostic** — `servicesFor(data, git)` composes
publish/read/authoring over ANY DataPort+GitPort (`store.tsx`). `git-local` is a real GitPort over
`isomorphic-git` (`commitFile`/`readFile`/`list`/`headSha`; **NO `fetch`/`pull`/`push` yet**, takes
`{dir,fs}`, dir must have `.git`). The **publish service already compiles draft→Markdoc + commits**
to repo-relative `content/<collection>/<locale>/<slug>.mdoc` AND has a **HEAD-based conflict guard**
(returns `conflict` not clobber). `db-sqlite` (better-sqlite3+drizzle) + `lock-policy` exist.
**The architecture already assumes content at repo-root `content/`** (that's what `contentPath`
emits) — the site is the outlier (reads `apps/site/content/`).

**The multi-topology model (the moat — refined with the owner).** A "topology" is THREE independent
choices, and the services don't care (the ports/adapters payoff), so we never build "a mode" — we
build *adapters*:
1. **Runtime:** Node (laptop *or* self-hosted server — same runtime) | Edge (Cloudflare Worker/Pages).
2. **Git backend:** local `.git` (git-local) | remote GitHub API (`git-github`, future).
3. **Drafts/locks store:** none (in-browser) | SQLite (Node) | D1 (edge).

| Topology | Runs on | Git | Drafts/locks | Adapters | Built? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Local dev** (FIRST CUT) | Node, laptop | local `.git` | in-browser | git-local, db-idb | ✅ all exist |
| **Self-hosted** | Node, server | local **or** GitHub | SQLite | + git-github | git-github ❌ |
| **Edge** | Cloudflare | **GitHub (must)** | D1 | + git-github, + db-d1 | both ❌ |

**Anchor:** **remote Git (GitHub) is the eventual single source of truth**; the local clone and the
live site are both *derivatives*. The local admin and a future Cloudflare admin are two faucets
writing the same remote.

**Decisions locked (2026-06-18):**
- **NO git submodule for content.** A submodule pins a SHA → Cloudflare would rebuild *old* content
  until a parent pointer-bump commit; breaks "edit→rebuild→live". Instead: **content in the same
  repo now** (top-level `content/`), and the productized end-state is **"the user's repo holds
  content+config and *depends on* Setu (npm/template)"** — separation without submodule pain.
- **Edge can't use local git** (a Worker has no persistent fs / `.git`) → edge ⇒ GitHub API + D1.
  Kills the "local git + Cloudflare" combo from the owner's list.
- **"local+remote git" / "remote only" are not modes** — they're the one future `git-github` adapter
  (+ an optional push-to-remote sync), added when a topology needs it.

**FIRST CUT — Local topology, "Cut A" ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-18 (`371ac42`):** only the **GitPort** goes
to a server; drafts stay in-browser. `apps/api` (**Hono/Node**, `createGitApi(git): Hono` over
4 RPC routes) wraps `git-local`; **`@setu/git-http`** (browser-side fetch GitPort, passes the shared
contract in-process against the real routes) talks to it; `Bootstrap.tsx` uses it when
`VITE_SETU_API` is set (else the in-browser path — 178 admin tests untouched). Content moved to
**repo-root `content/`** (Astro glob `base: '../../content'`). `pnpm dev` runs all three. Services/
round-trip untouched; e2e proves publish→git-http→api→git-local→disk. Spec/plan:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-18-setu-local-bridge*`.
**Caveats:** `git-local` doesn't follow a git *worktree's* `.git` pointer (use a normal checkout for
`SETU_REPO_DIR`); a fontsource `vite.ssr.noExternal` fix was needed so `astro dev` renders themed
routes (3c regression, build-only verification had masked it).

**Known v1 limitations to STATE (not discover):** (a) **drafts don't travel** across devices/admins
(in-browser) — publish before switching; (b) **"local behind remote"** needs git-local `fetch`/`pull`
(not built) — only matters once a 2nd faucet exists; (c) **concurrent-editor conflicts are coarse**
(whole-repo HEAD guard) until the `lock-policy` is wired to a shared DB; (d) edge needs a
**server-side GitHub token** + build-latency UX ("live in ~30s"). None block the first cut.

**NEXT adapters/increments (each = swap an adapter, zero service rewrites):** **Cut B** — server-side
drafts/locks via `db-sqlite` over HTTP (drafts travel across devices; real edit-locks via the
`lock-policy`); **`git-github`** GitPort (unlocks self-hosted-remote + remote-as-source-of-truth +
edge); **`db-d1`** + Cloudflare Worker/Pages runtime (the edge topology); git-local
`fetch`/`pull`/`push` (the "local behind remote" sync once a 2nd faucet exists); auth/tokens for any
non-local API. **The "View Site/View Page" preview-aware links are now unblocked** (a real site +
publish flow exist).

## Editor

### Editor feature wishlist — sequenced by content-model constraint (added 2026-06-16)

Owner dumped a feature wishlist during UAT of the enriched bubble. The gating factor is
**not** "add the Tiptap extension" — it's that **every new node/mark must round-trip through
Markdoc or it silently drops on publish** (the content-safety cardinal rule), plus a few need
the media backend or are render-time, plus a couple may be Tiptap **Pro** (Setu is 100% OSS →
build-our-own if so). Grouped by that constraint:

### ~~Bubble v2 — Turn-into regroup + subscript/superscript + checklist~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-17 (3 slices)

- slice 1 (`53019b7`): Turn-into dropdown regrouped into categories (Heading → levels, List →
  bullet/numbered/checklist, Quote, Code, sub/sup together).
- slice 2 (`96f1fd5`): **Subscript/Superscript** marks — inline `{% sub %}`/`{% sup %}` Markdoc
  tags (the `node.inline = true` round-trip finding); + surfaced block-type shortcuts.
- slice 3 (`87aa69b`): **Checklist** (TaskList/TaskItem, GFM `- [ ]`/`- [x]`) **+ list-wide
  nesting** (recursive converter both directions; bullet/numbered/checklist, mixed, unlimited
  depth). **Note: GFM task lists needed NO Markdoc tokenizer work** — Markdoc treats `- [ ]` as a
  bullet with literal text and round-trips all nesting byte-clean, so all logic lives in our
  converter. Underline remains deferred (same inline-tag pattern available to reuse).

**New nodes/marks needing `@setu/core` converter work first:**
- ~~**Tables**~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-17 (`276762d`): GFM pipe tables with per-column alignment.
  Core writes tables itself (`tableToGfm`) since Markdoc.format drops alignment; Markdoc stays the
  reader. `@tiptap/extension-table` (pinned 3.26.1) + cell `align` attr, slash insert, icon action
  menu, Tab/Shift-Tab cell nav + Tab-at-last-cell adds a row. No merged cells / resize / block-in-cell
  (GFM can't represent). Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-17-setu-tables*`.
- ~~**Text align**~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-17 (`8b42924`): L/C/R for paragraphs + headings via a Markdoc
  **node annotation** `{% align="center" %}` (read from `attributes.align`, written via the built
  node's `.annotations`; left emits nothing). `@tiptap/extension-text-align` + an L/C/R bubble group.
  Distinct from table-column alignment. Published-site rendering deferred to the render pipeline.
  Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-17-setu-text-align*`.
- **Text direction (RTL/LTR)** → `dir` attr; niche; same representation question — can reuse the
  node-annotation pattern established by text-align.

**Needs the media / render backend:**
- **Images** → Markdown `![alt](src)` round-trips, BUT image **upload** (where bytes go) needs the
  deferred **`ImagePort`/media pipeline** (PRD). Insert-by-URL is easy; upload is the real work.
  NOTE: the Tiptap **"image-node-pro"** UI component name suggests Pro — verify before use.
- **Code syntax highlighting** → code blocks already round-trip; highlighting is editor-DISPLAY via
  `@tiptap/extension-code-block-lowlight` (free MIT) + lowlight; main round-trip need is persisting
  the **language** (fence info string). Mostly additive/low-risk.

**Render-time / navigation (+ licensing to verify):**
- **Table of contents** → generated from headings, typically a render/theme concern, not stored
  content. The Tiptap ToC sits near **Pro** — VERIFY licensing; if Pro, build our own (it's a
  heading walk) or make it a theme/render feature.

**Licensing (HARD RULE, partially verified):** free MIT — Table, TextAlign, Subscript, Superscript,
TaskList, CodeBlockLowlight, Image. **To confirm not Pro-gated before committing:** Table-of-Contents,
the "image-node-pro" component.

### ~~Toolbar keyboard model — roving arrow nav + Esc-to-leave~~ ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-16 (enriched bubble)

Done in the enriched-bubble increment (`974f1b5`): `useToolbarRoving` roving-tabindex (←/→ +
Home/End) on the format bubble + the callout style toolbar; Esc leaves (bubble collapses the
selection; callout returns the caret to its body).

**Why deferred (decided with owner):** build the bubble's full keyboard model **once, together
with the enriched format bubble** — that increment adds many more controls (headings/lists/
quote/color/…), which is exactly when arrow-navigation earns its keep and the focus order needs
designing as a whole. Doing it piecemeal now would be redone when the button set changes.

**Touches:** `FormatBubble.tsx` (roving tabindex + arrow handler on the `role="toolbar"`),
the callout node-view toolbar (`Callout.tsx`), Esc-to-leave wiring (reuse `dismiss.ts`).

### Per-link attributes — "open in new window" + `nofollow` (deferred 2026-06-16)

**What:** let a writer set, per link: **open in a new window** (`target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener"`) and **`nofollow`** (and likely its cousins `sponsored` / `ugc` later). Surfaced while designing the format bubble / link card increment.

**Why deferred (not just UI):** standard Markdown links `[text](url)` **cannot carry `target` or `rel`**, so supporting these means **extending the Markdoc link representation in the core round-trip** (`packages/core/src/markdoc/`) — e.g. attributed links serialize as a `{% link href=… target=… rel=… %}` tag while plain links stay clean `[text](url)` — plus round-trip tests (content-safety / cardinal rule), and eventually the renderer applying them. That's content-model work in `@setu/core`, deliberately kept out of the editing-*feel* increment. Do it as its own tight slice.

**Note:** **"noindex" is NOT per-link** — it's a **page-level** directive (robots meta / `X-Robots-Tag`) that belongs in the SEO feature set (PRD §5), not on individual links. Per-link we only model `target` + `rel`.

**Touches:** `@setu/core` markdoc converter (both directions) + round-trip tests; the link card / bubble UI (attribute toggles); later, the SSG/SSR renderer.

### Underline round-trip support (deferred 2026-06-16)

**What:** StarterKit v3 bundles an **Underline** mark, but the Markdoc round-trip
(`packages/core/src/markdoc/`) doesn't serialize underline (Markdown has no underline) — so it
would silently drop on publish. We **disabled underline** in the format-bubble increment
(`underline: false`) to avoid content loss. To offer underline later: extend the converter
(e.g. an `{% u %}` tag or HTML passthrough) + round-trip tests, then re-enable the mark and add
a bubble button.

**Touches:** `@setu/core` markdoc converter + round-trip tests; StarterKit config; the format
bubble.
